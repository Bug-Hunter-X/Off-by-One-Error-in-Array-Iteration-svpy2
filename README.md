This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The `BuggyArray.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `FixedArray.java` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from using `i <= array.length` in the loop condition, which attempts access to an index that is out of bounds.  The solution uses the correct condition, `i < array.length`, to avoid this error. This example highlights the importance of careful array indexing in Java.
